//! Keep the Web Inspector out of the hole-punch layout.
//!
//! WebKit's inspector opens *attached* by default: it re-parents into the inspected view's
//! superview and reframes the inspected view from that **superview's** bounds. curator's content
//! webviews are `add_child` siblings positioned over the chrome's content hole, and they composite
//! above the chrome, so an attached inspector stretches the inspected tab across the whole window
//! — measured: a tab at `(240,0) 1260×1000` became `(0,0) 1500×500`. The sidebar isn't gone, it's
//! covered, which is why it also stops taking clicks.
//!
//! Forcing the inspector into its own window is the fix, not a workaround: an attached inspector
//! has no way to express "share the window with a sidebar it doesn't know about". Detaching alone
//! isn't enough — WebKit restores the view to fill the superview rather than to the hole it came
//! from — so the hole layout is re-applied afterwards.
//!
//! **The correction is here and nowhere else.** ⌥⌘I goes through
//! [`crate::commands::open_active_devtools`], but WebKit's own context menu ("Inspect Element") and
//! the inspector's dock buttons attach without touching curator code at all, so a fix at the menu
//! item can only ever cover one of three routes. [`watch_frame`] instead reacts to the *reframe
//! itself*: every content webview posts frame-change notifications, and a frame change while that
//! webview's inspector is visible means WebKit just attached it. That covers every route, including
//! ones that don't exist yet — and the menu handler deliberately does **not** also correct inline,
//! because detaching straight after `open_devtools` is the mid-transaction detach described below.
//!
//! **Timing is the whole difficulty here, and all three constraints were measured, not guessed:**
//!
//! - The frame notification is posted *synchronously inside `setFrame:`*, so the handler runs
//!   nested inside whatever Tauri call is positioning a webview. Doing the work there re-enters
//!   Tauri's window registry from inside one of its own webview ops and wedges the app.
//! - `-[_WKInspector detach]` spins a **nested runloop**, which dispatches queued main-thread work
//!   *inside* the detach — so a second pass starts mid-detach and nests again ([`IN_PROGRESS`]).
//! - Detaching while the attach transaction is still in flight never returns at all
//!   ([`SETTLE_MS`]).
//!
//! Hence the shape: notice on the notification, wait [`SETTLE_MS`] off-thread, then do the work in
//! one non-re-entrant pass on the main thread.
